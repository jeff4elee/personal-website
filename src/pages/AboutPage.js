                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Hi, welcome to my page!
                    I'm Jeffrey Lee, a second year at UCSD pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.
                    
                    I'm an avid student, software developer, and entrepreneur.
                    I'm a co-founder of a startup company called 605 Industries, whose mission is to develop a decentralized
                    education platform. We want to bring a more catered experience to students by allowing
                    content control to be dictated by the learners. As an eager self-learner myself, I envision this platform
                    to make learning less intimidating and to encourage an inclusive community.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Other than that, I love to cook, read, watch anime, and play various games, such as Overwatch and
                    League of Legends. I peaked S3, when I hit challenger, but not so soon after, I quit and became washed up. I've gotten back 
                    into playing this year, though. And aside from the things I mentioned above, I'm very open-minded and love to try new things.
                    So if you ever have a suggestion of something fun I could try, feel free to contact me!.
